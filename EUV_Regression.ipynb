    "   * Split the data into training and testing sets, default test size for this is 25% of the data\n",
    "3. Standardization\n",
    "   * Uses sklearn.StandardScaler(). We use fit_transform() on the training data, and transform() on the testing data\n",

    "     ElasticNet(fit_intercept=False, max_iter=100, random_state=42, alpha=1e-6, l1_ratio=0.5, selection='random', warm_start=True)\n",
    "   * a lower value for alpha will yield more coefficients, and a higher value will produce less. Higher alphas take more time to compute, as they will push more coefficients to zero. A more in depth description can be found on the sklearn docs: https://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.ElasticNet.html\n",
    "  \n",
    "5. Align results with Chianti\n",
    "   * For each regression, a chianti dataframe is created. The ion that most closely matches in wavelength to an EVE line is selected, and the coefficients are stored in that row. For example, HeII has an emission wavelength of 304 A. The model will produce the coefficients for a line at 304.4 A. So the lines that have these coefficients are stored in the dataframe in the HeII row.\n",
    "   * Then, the ChiantiPrep class calls functions to determine the location of the contributing ions based on their temperature in the database\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Find ratios of contribution over time, for each temperature range\n",
    "   * For each temperature zone, we find the ratio of contribution from the Corona and the Transition Region (TR). For example, if the lower TR contains only 1 ion, and that ion has contributions from 6 Corona ions and 4 TR ions, then the ratio is 0.4 (40% of the contribution comes from the TR)"
